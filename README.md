### Project Description
MotherCare Smart Reminder System is a web-based application designed to support pregnant women in maintaining a healthy daily routine. The system allows users to log in using their email or phone number and enter personal details such as name, age, pregnancy month, height, and weight. Based on the pregnancy month, it provides personalized guidance for food, medicines, vaccinations, and regular checkups. It also includes a manual to-do list feature to track important tasks and appointments. The main aim of this project is to improve maternal health awareness and ensure proper prenatal care through a simple and user-friendly interface
### The Problem statement
many rural pregnent women miss nutrition,guidance vaccination

### The Solution
MotherCare Smart Reminder System is an IoT-based healthcare support system that sends automated SMS alerts and emergency notifications to pregnant women and caregivers.
